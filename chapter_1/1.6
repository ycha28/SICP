The new-if form will result in an infinite recursion. This is because, unlike the special form, the new-if function uses a cond form, which uses applicative-order evaluation. Thus, all of the arguments are evaluated before the procedure is evaluated. The else clause contains a recursive call as its argument, so this recursive call gets evaluated before the procedure, which means we end up in an infinite recursion.
